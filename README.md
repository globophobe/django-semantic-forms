Django Semantic UI forms
------------------------

Django forms with [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) style. Semantic UI forms may be used both with [django-semantic-admin](https://github.com/globophobe/django-semantic-admin), as well as outside the admin.


Why?
----

* JavaScript datepicker and timepicker components.
* JavaScript selects, including multiple selections, which integrate well with Django autocomplete fields.
* Semantic UI has libraries for [React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) and [Vue](https://semantic-ui-vue.github.io/#/), in addition to jQuery. This means you can save time by using django-semantic-forms for simple forms, and use React or Vue for more complex use cases.


Install
-------

Install from PyPI:

```
pip install django-semantic-forms
```

Add to `settings.py`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "semantic_forms",
    ...
]
```

Please remember to run `python manage.py collectstatic` for production deployments.

This package uses [Fomantic UI](https://fomantic-ui.com/) the official community fork of Semantic UI. Please add the Fomantic UI dependencies to your Django template.
